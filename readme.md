# The ⭐️ `superstar` blockchain✨ for nobody in particular
    
🪐 Roadmap:
1. Deploy the unmodified blockchain-starship the starport provides
2. Get it `flying` in production mode
3. If it survives the launch, brag to your friends that you have a blockchain.
4. Name it and feed it 🌟
5. Try to update to version 2 which privately adds 2 + 2 to force proper update.
6. Learn your 64th programming language and your 189th javascript framework
7. Develop application specific blockchain to enter web 3
8. Link it to your web2.0 app which is still backwards compatible with your web1.0 app
9. Enjoy the simple things in life if there are any left 💫

Origin of the name 'Superstar' - it was the third starport app name I could think of. The first two app folders ended up with ruined parts of code, which I caused without much understanding. That got me to the moment in which I angriliy entered 'superstar' for third project name. Epic moment for humanity


**superstar** is a blockchain built using Cosmos SDK and Tendermint and created with [Starport](https://github.com/tendermint/starport).
